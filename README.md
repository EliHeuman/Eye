The Eye Exercise concludes the eighth week of the MIT xPRO Full Stack Development with MERN course.

## Description of the Project 
Eye enables you to move your cursor across the screen and watch as the eyes follow. This game uses mainly CSS.
___
## How to Run
After cloning this project, you will see it consists of three main files.<br>
index.html, styles.css, eyes.js.<br>
The index.html file sets the DOM buttons that call the functions to create, move and delete the Pacman.
The pacmen.js does all the heavy lifting, creating an array of pacman called "pacMen" and loping through the array to move them and check if they've hit a wall. Depending on each packman's direction, the function "switchImg" changes the image to create a feeling that the packman is moving.

## Roadmap of future improvements
- When you click start multiple times, the velocity increasesâ€”planning to limit this option.
- Add a button to reduce packmen individually one at a time.
